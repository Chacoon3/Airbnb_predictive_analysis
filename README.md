# Airbnb_predictive_analysis

- This is a machine learning project. It contains visualizations, datasets, documents, team-developed R libraries, trained models, as well as source codes. The project was for competing in the machine learning competition of the course <b>BUDT 758T: Data Mining and Predictive Aanalytics</b> offered by the R. H. Smith Business School at the University of Maryland.

- In this project, the repository owner along with other four teammates collaborated to train a machine learning model that best ranks the popularity of Airbnb accomodations as were measured by a categorical target variable <b> high_booking_rate</b>.

- We finalized with a XGBoost model which had its AUC being 0.903, the highest AUC among all the teams that parcipated in this competition.
